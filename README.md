# Weather Website

Welcome to this weather website! This project was developed as part of the IEEE web team, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The site provides a user-friendly interface for users to check weather details for their desired location. It leverages the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch real-time weather data.
<br/>
**To enhance the user experience with a touch of innovation, the background dynamically adjusts to reflect the current weather conditions.**
<br/>
Feel free to explore the website and check the weather conditions for your city or any other place you're interested in.
